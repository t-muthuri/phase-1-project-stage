Stage is an online platform where people book and track public service vehicles from the comfort of their home,office or workplace.

# pitch

Standing at the bus stop and waiting for the next public service vehicle to arrive is a common trend in  Nairobi. Sitting in a matatu (a public service vehicle) or a bus for half an hour or more and waiting for it to fill up with passengers is nothing uncommon.

In a fast-paced economy, however, every second counts. Balancing between work, play and home teeters too close to being offset by the time spent in transit. A platform that allows people to keep track of when the next bus or matatu arrives at the bus stop and when they will fill up to capacity at the stage will be an invaluable tool to help save on their time.
